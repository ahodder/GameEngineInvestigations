# Overview
This project is the on going investigation I have into as close as possible full implementation of a C# game engine.

- The only caveat is a dependency on Raylib, however, as the engine and investigation continue, this may eventually be 
removed.


## Current Working Subsystems

### ECS
Currently the Cyberstar engine has implemented a fully functional ECS sub system. This will allow for entity game object
processing providing data locality.
